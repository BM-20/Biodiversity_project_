This goal of this project is to analyse biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations. This project will scope, analyse, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.

Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:

What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
Which species were spotted the most at each park?
Data sources: Both Observations.csv and Species_info.csv was provided by https://www.codecademy.com/

Note: The data for this project is inspired by real data, but is mostly fictional.
